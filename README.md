**`Physicist | Programmer | Freelancer`**

I am a highly skilled physics enthusiast with a Master's degree in Physics, and a strong passion for programming and simulation in engineering. My expertise lies in developing computer codes using C++ and MATLAB for computational physics simulations, with a particular focus on electromagnetics.

As a simulation engineer and freelance programmer, I have worked on various projects in electrical, mechanics, and plasma engineering. I take pride in my ability to collaborate with clients and develop robust and scalable software solutions to complex problems.

One of my key areas of focus is exploring GPU acceleration to optimize FDTD simulations. I am constantly researching the latest technologies and methodologies to implement this technique into my work, ensuring that I achieve the best possible results for my clients.

I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, and I enjoy working with others to learn and grow. My strong work ethic, attention to detail, and dedication to improving the efficiency and speed of my simulations have earned me a reputation for delivering high-quality work on time and within budget.

In my free time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in the fields of physics and computer science, and I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge.
